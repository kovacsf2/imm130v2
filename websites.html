<h2 id="top">My Three Favorite Websites</h2>
<!-- YouTube, Reddit, Wikipedia? -->
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p><a href="http://youtube.com">
YouTube</a><br />
Ah, YouTube. The place where all the greatest content and video equivalent<br />
of shovelware gets to be viewed by the masses. A simple site with an even<br />
simpler design; compact, visually pleasing, easy to navigate. The classic<br />
red, white, blue, and grey color scheme helps bring the whole site together.
</p>
<h3>Reddit</h3>
<p><a href="http://reddit.com">
Reddit</a><br />
Reddit: also known as 4chan's sober brother. Reddit is a culmination of<br />
user's life stories, funny and serious videos, memes, and the occasional<br />
post that makes you regret having eyes and learning to read. Much like<br />
YouTube, Reddit uses the classic upvote/downvote system. View subreddits<br />
of your favorite / most despised celebrity, play some 50/50 and risk<br />
mental scarring in order to see either dogs or p0rn, or what some mild<br />
karma.
</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p><a href="http://google.com">
Google</a><br />
The gateway to the entire entity that is the surface web. Google is the<br />
Pandora's Box of the internet. Literally everything you need to find<br />
(legal or not); all the information in the palm of your hands.
